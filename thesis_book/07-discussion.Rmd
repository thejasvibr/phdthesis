 # General Discussion

We have so far delved into detailed reports of work studying echolocation in groups, and various methodological contributions to the field. In this section I will summarise some broad points of interest, and end with my vision for the future of the field. 

## The 'cocktail party nightmare': a hyperbolic term
In their influential review over a decade ago @ulanovsky2008a coined the term 'cocktail party nightmare' to describe the sensory challenge echolocating bats face in groups. How do individual bats manage to detect their own echoes over the deafening calls of neighbours, how to recognise one's own echoes from the constant stream of others' echoes and calls? In comparison to the cocktail party problems that humans (and perhaps other animals) face, the stakes of not detecting an echo seemed high (collision with obstacles), and the emitted sound levels definitely are much higher. The escalation from *problem* to *nightmare* aptly describes the perceived seriousness of group echolocation. Studies since then revealed a variety of responses that echolocators show in their call behaviour to playbacks, and in group flights. Bats were studied as 'emitters' of signals, but understudied as 'receivers'. 

To understand bats as receivers in group echolocation, one must the quantify the extent to which echo detection suffers in groups. The next step is to quantify how much the exhibited call alterations improve echo detection. Using a computational model that recreated the biology, acoustics and geometry of bat groups in great detail I quantified the 'cocktail party nightmare' for FM bats in great detail in Chapter @cpnchapter. The results of the model show that when in small groups (<10bats), echo detection is unaffected. All  available echoes are detected regularly each time a call is emitted, and all neighbours spread around the focal bat can be detected  too. With increasing group sizes ($\\geq$30) however, the problem of masking begins to play a progressively stronger role. Already at group sizes of a 100 bats, a focal bat in the middle of the group can only detect at most one neighbour per call emission, and that too only every third call emission. The neighbour that is detected occasionally is the nearest neighbour located in the front of the emitting bat. The high density of intense calls and other bats' echoes means that two of three call emissions will result in the returning echo being masked. At much larger group sizes of 200 bats, the probability of hearing an echo decreases drastically to almost zero. 

If bats in large groups can only detect their nearest neighbour in front of them occasionally, how can groups chow collective movements like milling using echolocation? @bode2011a provide an answer with their 'limited interactions' model. @bode2011a show that collective movement emerges even when individuals asynchronously update their own positions with reference to just one neighbour. My model showed that despite the severity of masking in groups, echo detection occurs at large group sizes of a 100 bats. The model however implemented a simple auditory model of echo detection - that did not include dynamic information processing (integration over multiple echoes), temporal gating or attentional processes. The results from the model are thus lower bound estimates of what a real echolocator may experience, and questions the severity of the problem that bats may experience in groups. I wonder now if a bats in groups experience a cocktail party 'nightmare', or more of a *'challenge'*?

## Free-flying bats do not show altered echolocation in groups

*
* In HBC for isntance new methods were developed to analyse overlapping calls - and this hadn't been attempted before. Doing so, helped us re-afirm the lack of a CF shifting. 

## *Ushichka* as a model dataset for group active sensing 
* 
* Developing the methodology and investing in the equipment is not an easy task. eg. how I see Ushichka as an astronomy-type dataset where large multi-disciplinary collaborations can be built around it. 

* @bode2011a also observed a geometric anisotropy in group structure as a result of this 'nearest neighbour' updating, as did @ballerini2008a in starling flocks. This raises an important question of whether groups of bats 


* As we know now *T. brasiliensis* has a uniform neighbour distribution in the azimuth and elevation - this might actually be explained by the fact that it's an emergence behaviour - which is visually driven. Studies inside dark cave sites where bats must rely solely on echolocation (eg. Ushichka) will be better to test which behavioural heuristics  animals are follwing (and thus which computational model best describes their behaviour). Would be interesting to check how models parametrised pursely w vision [@TOCOMPLETEROMANCZUK] compare with models that assume echolocation based neighbour detection. 

* Implications of group echolocation on collective behaviour 

## Lowering the technical barriers to study group echolocation 
* measurement-free, array-free acoustic tracking setups. The more scaleable your mic array is - the better you can track echolocating bats. 
* package to estimate and simulate the acoustic tracking performance  pre-hoc or post-hoc. Inspired by easyCam packages - which help users estimate the accuracy of 3d tracking for camera arrays. 

## The future of group active sensing research 

### Parametrising group active sensing in bats and other model systems
The shifting focus of active sensing research from single animals to multi animal groups is understandable as communities of researchers work on developing the increasingly sophisticated technologies required. As with bat echolocation, so it has also been with electric fish. Oilbirds, swiftlets, certain fruit bats and other odontocete echolocators also come to mind. While odontocetes and some fruit bats (so far *Rousettus aegyptiacus* and *R. leschenaulti*) emit very short 'clicks' about tens to hundreds of microseconds long. The probability of an echo being jammed is proportional to the duration of the calls being emitted in a group [@BELEYUR], and in this sense, click-based echolocators are unlikely to suffer problems detecting echoes because of call-echo (or click-echo in this case) overlaps. Short click-based echolocators are still however likely to suffer from all the other related issues that a vertebrate auditory bauplan brings, for example forward and backward masking [@Nachtigall2014], and even perhaps informational masking. Oilbirds and swiflets also emit clicks, but these clicks are much closer in duration to bat echolocation calls, ranging from a one to tens of milliseconds [@brinklov2013echolocation] - making them much more likely to suffer the same kinds of call-echo overlaps that bats do in groups. How click based echolocators manage to recognise their own echoes from the echoes of others is an interesting question that I think is particularly worth pursuing in the future. One strategy echolocating bats may use to recognise their own echoes is the presence of unique vocal signatures or 'voices' [@YOVEL;@MASTERS] in their echolocation calls. Clicks are indeed defined by the apparent absence of spectro-temporal structure [@pye1980echolocation], and their impulse-like structure (much like the clapping of the hand, or a hammer hitting a surface), and given their generally short durrations are so are somewhat unlikely to carry individual-specific signatures. Of course, the absence of a 'voice' in click-based echolocation doesn't preclude the use the other mechanisms that may be common to all echolocators to filter out 'ranging noise', such as temporal gating (using echoes that arrive within an expected time window) or using directional cues to filter out off-target echoes arriving from behind or the sides. 

As receivers, all groups of active sensing echolocators known to date (birds and mammals) are likely to face the common problem of masking. Evidence for the occurence of masking is old, but systematic tests in the context of echolocation have only been done in laryngeal-echolocating bats and odontocetes [@Nachtigall2014]. Even in these two well studied groups, only a few species have been studied [*E. fuscus*,*M. lyra*].  Most discussions of masking in echolocation have typically been centred around one type of masking, *energetic* masking. Energetic masking is a physiologically driven phenomena where the intensity of louder sounds suppresses the detection of fainter sounds [@YOST]. Another, less discussed type of masking is *informational* masking. Informational masking occurs when signal detection is affected, despite the absence of energetic masking (no temporal or spectral overlap) [@YOST]. For instance, humans experience informational masking when trying to listen to a sentence with unrelated words in between [@TOCOMPLETE]. Unlike energetic masking that occurs primarily at the cochlear level, informational masking is thought to occur due to the interplay of attention and other higher-order phenomena [@TOCOMPLETE]. To my knowledge, there remain no studies of informational masking in echolocating animals - and this presents a yet unexplored facet in the study of individual and group echolocation. Here, I see the scope for the next wave of multi-species phantom echo studies [eg. @SURLYKKe;@SIMMONS;] whose results can be directly used to construct 'masking functions' (sensu @BELEYURGOERLITZ2019). Echolocating bats vary in the continuum of group sizes that they live in [@ECOLOGYOFBATS], and this means the extent of masking that they are likely to experience from conspecifics will also vary. Does this typical group-size based masking have an effect on the actual ability of individuals to detect echoes in noise? It may also be that the robustness of echolocation to noise is more strongly affected by the environmental clutter and reverberance, rather than roosting group size per se.  Studying a wider variety of species will allow us to explore the ecological and evolutionary basis of masking tolerance. 

As emitters, groups of echolocators have a series of choices on how and where to focus their probe's energy. 

### The three-pronged approach to solve the inverse problem of group active sensing 
The study of biological problems is full of inverse problems [@TOCOMPLETEBIOLOGYUNDERTHEINFUEX]. We observe a range of fascinating phenomena, but often are unable to (and perhaps will never be able to!) recreate them under controlled settings. In this respect, biological, geological and cosmological phenomena must be tackled with a synergetic approach involving 1) pushing new technologies to generate improved measurements, 2) performing scaled experiments wherever possible, and finally 3) formulating computational/theoretical models that explain and predict.

In the case of active sensing, new technologies promise to lower the barrier for entry into acoustic tracking. In this thesis itself [Chapter @sfscotdoa], we see the starting steps to a field-friendly  workflow for self-calibration of mic positions. In its more developed form, this workflow will closely mirror current camera array calibration workflows (eg. @Theriault2014). The bioacoustician only needs to arrive at the field site, setup the microphones unobtrusively in the recording volume, and may perhaps need to perform playbacks with a small speaker afterwards (the animal vocalisations could themselves be used to calibrate the mic positions themselves!). Multi-channel microphone arrays are of course typically associated with reams of cables extruding from the soundcard to the microphones. Cables need constant maintenance, and can in my experience, contribute to a considerable portion of heavy equipment to be carried through. Moving forward I see the scope for either wireless multi-channel recording systems, or more strategically, promise for acoustic tracking with many independently recording devices. Acoustic tracking needs accurate time-difference of arrivals, and this has always been done so far using multi-channel soundcards that digitise data synchronously for all channels. In principle however, time-difference-of-arrivals may also be measured across two unsynchronised channels as long as the temporal offset between them is known. Similar to position self-calibration, recent methods to post-hoc estimate offset between asynchronous channels [@burgess2012node;@burgess2013minimal] promise another practical blessing to the bioacoustician in the field. Acoustic tracking may then be done with with many smaller, cheaper and more portable recording devices. A future workflow may even include placing hundreds to thousands of hand-held recorders in a cave, recording data, and then finally performing playbacks for cross-device synchronisation and position calibration.

'scaled experiments' might mean running controlled lab experiments with small groups of animals in flightrooms, or more importantly performing psychophysical experiments with trained animals to understand their capabilities. 
* Phantom-echo playback type studies
* Even just repeating the same experiments (eg. Suemer 2019, or Amichai's conspecific playback) across multiple studies could reveal a lot.

Despite the constant focus on sensory systems in this thesis, it is important to remember that active sensing animals are not merely 'sensors'. Echolocating bats are living, breathing animals that perform rapid, well co-ordinated *behaviours* using the sensory inputs they receive. Bats exhibit a host of fascinating behaviours using echolocation, including catching prey, fly long distances, care for their young, among which group flight is perhaps the most tantalising to piece-together conceptually. The bystander bioacoustician watching a  mating swarm of a few hundred bats flying in a cave is only occupied by the many reasons this shouldn't even be possible in the first place! With inverse problems, modelling provides us a way to explore the feasibility of the proposed mechanism, and 'revise our thinking about the processes occuring' [@otto2011biologist]. How can collective behaviours like swarming or cave emergence occur, despite the limited sensory inputs individuals receive about their neighour positions? For that matter, given the sophistication of bat echolocation in experimental noise, does an individual bat actually even perceive a drop in sensory input rate? Models of group echolocation [eg. Chapter @cpnchapter,@TOCOMPLETE-mazaryovel] rely on the input data used to parametrise them, which are often scarce. Even existing models when parametrised with new data may reveal a much more nuanced picture. Modelling may reveal that echo detection in groups occurs well, but the sensory challenge is attentional [@lemasson2009], ie. to choose the most relevant one in the shortest possible time to avoid collision. Even if bats are capable of tracking the positions of all of their neighbours in a group, may be they only respond to the closest one - much like the collision-avoidance heuristic shown in @vanderelst2015sensorimotor. 

The three-pronged approach to study group echolocation advocated above is of course no task for a single investigator. The approach involves a dedicated back-and-forth between disciplinary ideas, methods and people. It is my hope to have provided a cursory glimpse in this thesis of the contributions it can bring. How active sensing animals aggregate and perform impressive feats is an exciting problem that has occupied and will continue occupied many of us. The bats however, they carry on unphased by their own abilities: milling around an invisible centre in pitch black caves and emerging in smoke-like streams in the light of the setting sun.

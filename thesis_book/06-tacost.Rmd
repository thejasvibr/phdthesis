## Abstract {-#tacostabstract}
`tacost` is a Python package to allow the testing of acoustic tracking systems. While many microphone array systems have been characterised analytically and experimentally - these are time-intensive methods. `tacost` provides a simulation based framework to rapidly assess the tracking behaviour of multiple array geometries, and the dissection of other relevant parameters. This paper explains briefly the design of the package and highlights two example use cases in which the tracking accuracy of different microphone geometries are characterised.

## Introduction
Acoustic tracking is a common method used to study vocalising animals such as birds, bats and cetaceans [@suzuki2017harkbird;@aubauer1994dreidimensionale;@mohl2000sperm;@Hugel2017;@Holderied20032293;@rhinehart2020a;@blumstein2011a].
Using acoustic tracking, biologists can detect the position of the animal and track it through space as it moves over time. The localisation accuracy of an acoustic tracking system depends on a variety  of factors. There are *internal* factors such as microphone array geometry, signal processing routines, and the mathematical formulations used to localise sounds (time-of-arrival, time-of-arrival-difference, angle-of-arrival, power-steering). The *external* factors include aspects related to the actual signal itself, ie. signal-to-noise ratio, and spectro-temporal properties of the emitted sound (noise, linear/hyperbolic sweep) [@Wahlberg1999]. 
While experiments and analytical modelling may be the definitive way to determine a tracking system's end accuracy, simulations allow  a quick and systematic method to estimate the source of tracking errors. `tacost` provides a flexible workflow to manipulate and study the effect of both internal and external factors. `tacost`  generates audio files for source positions and array geometries specified by the user. This allows the user to analyse the efficacy of their tracking system's baseline performance.


## Statement of need
Generating simulated audio for a set of source sounds, positions and a given array configuration is a relatively simple task. However, to my knowledge, there are no publicly available, tested and documented packages for this task published to date. Codebases that are publicly available have the advantage of being used by a larger user-base and can thus benefit from bug discoveries much faster than in-house or individually written one-time use scripts.  `tacost` provides a robust and well-documented software workflow [@Taschuk2016]  with user and developer friendly documentation [hosted online](https://tacost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). `tacost` contributes to the Python scientific ecosystem in the hope of promoting the growth of acoustics and bioacoustic research in open-source languages like Python. In particular, `tacost` will help researchers working in the field of acoustics and bio-acoustics [eg. @deframond2020] plan and examine the behaviour of their acoustic tracking systems. 


## Design 
The design of `tacost` focusses on a reproducible and user-friendly method [@Wilson2012] to generate WAV files that form the input for acoustic tracking softwares. Users may interact with `tacost` through custom-written Python scripts
by calling it as a Python package with ```import tacost``` or in the 'no-coding' mode. The 'no-coding' mode is especially suitable for users unfamiliar with Python. The no-coding mode is based around a parameter file that is used to specify various parts of the WAV file to be created.
Through the parameter file the user can specify the emitted sound, source positions, inter-sound-intervals, sampling rate and other relevant variables to customise the test scenario.

## Examples

The localisation accuracy of a microphone array may not be uniform over 3D space [@aubauer1994dreidimensionale;@Wahlberg1999]. This accuracy is independent of the actual signal and recording conditions of the input data, but rather dependent on the array geometry and mathematical formulations used to record and calculate sound source position.

The accuracy of a few microphone array configurations has been characterised analytically [@aubauer1994dreidimensionale] and experimentally [@Wahlberg1999]. While reflecting the system's capabilities, analytical 
and experimental characterisations are often time-intensive. In contrast, simulation uncovers the intrinsic accuracy of an array relatively quickly through the use of audio files with simulated emission points spread across the recording volume of interest. 
`tacost` can be used to characterise the maximal localisation accuracy of an acoustic tracking system with novel array geometries and recording scenarios. In Example 1, I show how `tacost` can be used to verify known trends in 
localisation error with the tristar60, a commonly used array system. In Example 2, I show how `tacost` can be used to estimate the expected localisation error in a multi-microphone array with a novel and field-friendly geometry.

### Localisation accuracy of the tristar60 system
The tristar60 array is a commonly used array geometry [@aubauer1994dreidimensionale;@Holderied20032293;@Hugel2017;@Lewanzik2018] with 4 microphones in a plane on an inverted T array. Three peripheral microphones are placed 120$^{\circ}$ to each other at 60 cm radial distance from the central mic on the inverted T-array. 

A series of emission points spanning the upper right quadrant of the array were simulated. The emitted sound was set to a linear sweep. The output WAV files from `tacost` were run through the TOADSuite package [@holger_toadsuite_manual;@toadsuite_peterstilz], a software package that localises sounds using the time-of-arrival-differences across channels. Figure \ref{tacostfig1} shows the localisation accuracy map 
for the tristar60 microphone array. It can be seen (Figure \ref{tacostfig1}) that localisation error increases with increasing radial distance from the central microphone, and remains <7$\%$ of the radial distance.

A) The tristar60 microphone array is placed at the origin of the coordinate system (bottom left, orange dots connected by black lines). The blue points are the simulated source positions which form a 'calibration grid'. The size of each dot is proportional to the localisation error B) The localisation error increases with increasing radial distance of source from the central microphone. The error is the euclidean distance between the predicted and simulated source point.The errors range between 0-0.7m. C) The relative error of localisation, defined as $\frac{Localisation \:error}{Distance \:from \:central \:microphone}$. Even though absolute localisation error tends to increase with distance from array, all localisation happens with <7 $\%$ relative error.}

### Localisation accuracy of a multi-microphone array in the field 
While recording in the field, it may be difficult to use fixed arrays mounted on stands. Arrays on stands are difficult to carry and may also influence the behaviour of the animals being recorded. It is thus advantageous to use less obtrusive microphone geometries, for instance by  placing microphones on pre-existing structures such as the walls of a cave or trees. These microphone geometries are field-friendly, but their localisation accuracy is hard to characterise analytically. `tacost` is an ideal tool to explore the tracking performance of such flexibly placed microphone arrays. 

Figure \ref{tacostfig2}A shows the microphone array geometry and recording system described in [@sfs_cotdoa]. In short, the array consisted of 11 microphones, 4 of them on a 120cm tristar, and the remaining 7 microphones attached to the walls of a cave. A series of sound emission points were created simulating points in the volume enclosed by the array. The points matched the volume echolocating bats flew within. The simulated sound was set to a linear sweep, which mimicked that of a bat call. The `tacost` output WAV files were analysed with the TOADSuite. The resulting accuracy map reveals that overall, the localisation error is between 7-30 centimetres for the given emission points. This corresponds to a maximum error of upto 30cm in tracking the position, and of upto 19$\%$ relative error. In contrast to the previous example highlighting the increase in tracking error with increasing source sound distance, these results show a somewhat different trend. The relative error is also much higher, and it may have to do with the positioning of the sound sources in the volume with reference to the array. The relative location of the sound source affects the tracking accuracy [@aubauer1994dreidimensionale].

A) The line-connected points (orange) represent the microphone array consisting of 11 microphones. Four microphones are in a tristar 120 array (left, tristar array with 120cm radial distance from central mic), and 
the remaining 7 mics are placed on the walls of the cave (top right, two quadirlateral outlines joined at a common vertex represent the 7 mics on the cave walls). The free-standing points (blue) are  the simulated emission points which form a 'calibration grid'. Each simulated point is shown as a dot, and the size of the dot is proportional to the tracking error. B) The distribution of localisation error. The error is 
the euclidean distance between the predicted and simulated point. The localisation error is between 0.07-0.32 m for the given points. C) The relative localisation error with reference to the central mic of the 120 cm tristar array microphone. The 95$\%$ile bounds of tracking error lie between 3.7-16.6$\%$, with a maximum of 18.8$\%$ error. Even points that are nearby seem to be localised with a higher relative error. This higher relative error may be the result of sound source position with reference to the microphone array.}

## Future directions
`tacost` as it stands is currently written to implement a first-order assessment of a tracking system's accuracy. The package has been primarily written keeping acoustic signals propagating through air where the velocity of sound is assumed to be constant. It may also be used to test tracking in radar or underwater sonar systems, contingent on how uniform the medium of wave propagation is over the distances being studied. As of version 0.1.0
, straight line propagation of signals are simulated, without spherical spreading or atmospheric absorption implemented. Future releases may include such propagation losses. Another important aspect affecting all tracking systems is the directionality of the sensors (microphones) and emitted signals (animal vocalisations, calibration speakers). A common problem in acoustic tracking with bats and cetaceans is not being able to track animals because their echolocation calls can be very directional [@matsuta2013adaptive;@Surlykke2012;@Koblitz2016]. Implementing sensor and source sound directionality will help assessing how many microphones might be required to successfully track animals in their surroundings, and which array geometries are best able to do so.

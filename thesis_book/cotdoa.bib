 abstract             = {The displacement analysis problem for planar and spatial mechanisms can be written as a system of multivariate polynomial equations. Elimination theory based on resultants and polynomial continuation are some of the methods that have been used to solve this problem. This paper presents a new approach to displacement analysis using the reduced Gr\"{o}bner basis form of a system of equations under degree lexicographic (dlex) term ordering of its monomials and Sylvester's Dialytic elimination method. Using the Gr\"{o}bner-Sylvester hybrid approach, a finitely solvable system of equations F is transformed into its reduced Gr\"{o}bner basis G using dlex term ordering. Next, using the entire or a subset of the set of generators in G, the Sylvester's matrix is assembled. The vanishing of the resultant, given as the determinant of Sylvester's matrix, yields the necessary condition for polynomials in G (as well as F) to have a common factor. The proposed approach appears to provide a systematic and rational procedure to the problem discussed by Roth, dealing with the generation of (additional) equations for constructing the Sylvester's matrix. Three examples illustrating the applicability of the proposed approach to displacement analysis of planar and spatial mechanisms are presented. The first and second examples address the forward displacement analysis of the general 6-6 Stewart mechanism and the 6-6 Stewart platform, whereas the third example deals with the determination of the I/O polynomial of an 8-link 1-DOF mechanism that does not contain any 4-link loop.},

For example, given a video recording of a talking person, we would like to estimate a 3D model of the lips and the full face and its internal modes of variation. Many solutions that recover 3D shape from 2D image sequences have been proposed; these so-called structure-from-motion techniques usually assume that the 3D object is rigid. For example, C. Tomasi and T. Kanades' (1992) factorization technique is based on a rigid shape matrix, which produces a tracking matrix of rank 3 under orthographic projection. We propose a novel technique based on a non-rigid model, where the 3D shape in each frame is a linear combination of a set of basis shapes. Under this model, the tracking matrix is of higher rank, and can be factored in a three-step process to yield pose, configuration and shape. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model free approach that can recover! from single-view video sequences nonrigid shape models. We demonstrate this new algorithm on several video sequences. We were able to recover 3D non-rigid human face and animal models with high accuracy},

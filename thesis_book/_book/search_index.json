About the SFS methodology : Multi-microphone arrays have been an important and indispensable tool in the study of echolocation in the laboratory ever since the work of [Aubauer XXXX]. Working with microphone arrays in the field however comes with a series of challenges. Handling multi-microphone arrays in the field can be logistically and physically straining: the long cables involved must be brought to order each time, the arrays themselves can be bulky and must be assembled on site each time, and in certain configurations the positions of each microphone may need to be measured each time the array is setup. While rewarding in terms of the data it generates, the process of setting up a microphone array can be strenuous especially when it comes to taking positional measurements of microphone positions. The use of TotalStation type surveying systems that provide direct XYZ measurements are not common in the field (they are themselves another piece of bulky equipment), and instead it is more common to measure inter-microphone distances with a tape measure or laser range finders.

R. (2019). Modeling active sensing reveals echo detection even in large groups of bats. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 116(52), 26662-26668. TODO STUFF: Abstract Active sensing animals perceive their surroundings by emitting probes of energy and analyzing how the environment modulates these probes. However, the probes of conspecifics can jam active sensing, which should cause problems for groups of active sensing animals. This problem was termed the cocktail party nightmare for echolocating bats: as bats listen for the faint returning echoes of their loud calls, these echoes will be masked by the loud calls of other close-by bats. Despite this problem, many bats echolocate in groups and roost socially. Here, we present a biologically parametrized framework to quantify echo detection in groups. Incorporating properties of echolocation, psychoacoustics, acoustics, and group flight, we quantify how well bats flying in groups can detect each other despite jamming. A focal bat in the center of a g roup can detect neighbors in group sizes of up to 100 bats. With increasing group size, fewer and only the closest and frontal neighbors are detected. Neighbor detection is improved by longer call intervals, shorter call durations, denser groups, and more variable flight and sonar beam directions. Our results provide a quantification of the sensory input of echolocating bats in collective group flight, such as mating swarms or emergences. Our results further generate predictions on the sensory strategies bats may use to reduce jamming in the cocktail party nightmare. Lastly, we suggest that the spatially limited sensory field of echolocators leads to limited interactions within a group, so that collective behavior is achieved by following only nearest neighbors. 2.1 Introduction Active sensing animals use self-generated energy to sense their surroundings by analyzing how objects around them change the emitted energy (Nelson and MacIver 2006). Bats emit loud ultrasonic calls and detect objects around them by listening to the echoes (Fenton 2013,@griffin1958a)reflected off these objects. Active sensing is an effective sensory modality when the animal is solitary. However, when multiple active sensing animals emit pulses of energy in close proximity,they may“jam”each other and mutually interfere with their ability to detect objects in their environment (Nelson and MacIver 2006,@matsubara1978a). If groups of echolocating bats mutually jam or mask each other, they would not be able to detect each other. Due to the intense jamming,individuals would have a progressively difficult time detecting the echoes reflecting off their neighbors, and thus not detect their neighbors at all. Without detecting each other, groups of individuals cannot show collision-free flight. However, many bat species are very gregarious, and fly and echolocate together in groups of tens to millions of bats. Bat groups also show coordinated behaviors in cave flights, evening emergences, and mating swarms (Ortega 2016,@kunz1982a). How is their ability to detect each other impaired by increasing group size? How many of its neighbors does a bat actually detect in the presence of intense jamming? What strategies may improve echo detection and thus neighbor detection when many active sensing animals are together? We present biologically parametrized simulations to answer how bats manage to echolocate in the face of intense jamming.In human psychophysics, the sensory challenge of perceiving an auditory cue among other similar sounds has been called the“cocktail party problem”(Cherry 1953,@bee2008a). When applied to bat echolocation,the cocktail party problem has been elevated to the“cocktailparty nightmare,”given the high repetition rate, similarity, and amplitude of echolocation calls. On top of these factors is the nonlinear increase in the number of masking sounds with in-creasing group size (Ulanovsky and Moss 2008). Empirical studies to date have investigated the cocktail party problem from a sender’s perspective (Bee and Micheyl 2008, @ulanovsky2008a, @brumm2005a). Through field observations, playback studies, and on-bodytags (Amichai, Blumrosen, and Y. 2015,@cvikel2015a, @gillam2010a,@gillam2016a,@lin2016a,@ulanovsky2004a,@habersetzer1981a, @jones1993a,@jarvis2013a,@adams2017a,@falk2014a,@surlykke1993a), we now know a range of echolocation strategies that bats show under challenging acoustic conditions. Bats can increase their call intensity, alter their call duration and fre-quency range, or suppress calling in the presence of conspecifics and noise playbacks (Amichai, Blumrosen, and Y. 2015,@adams2017a,@tressler2009a,@m1989a). In contrast to the many reports of bats’ responses to noisy conditions, very little work has been done in conceptually understanding how receiver strategies might contribute to dealing with the cocktail party nightmare (Lin and Abaid 2015, @perkins2017a). To our knowledge, biological modeling of the cocktail party nightmare from a receiver’s perspective that includes the details of bat echolocation and auditory processing is lacking. We fill this gap in conceptual understanding by presenting a biologically parametrized model based on the known properties of bat audition and the acoustics of a multi bat echolocation scenario. We quantified how well a bat flying with conspecifics can perceive its neighbors in terms of the returning echoes it detects. Through our simulations, we arrive at a sensory estimate of what a bat in the cocktail party nightmare may be detecting, if anything at all. 2.2 Materials and methods We model the echolocation of frequency-modulating (FM) bats. The calls of FM bats are typically downward frequency-modulated and of short duration(≤5 ms). Each call is followed by a longer silence (80–150 ms) called the interpulse interval (Jones, Griffin, and Galambos (1999)). FM bats thus sense their world“stroboscopically” by emitting a call and listening for the echoes returning during the interpulse interval (Griffin and Galambos (1941)). In the absence of any loud conspecific calls, a bat is able to hear all returning echoes and thus to detect all objects around it. However, in the presence of other loud bat calls, some of its own returning echoes may be masked. In that case, the bat will hear a few or none of the returning echoes.This corresponds to the bat detecting a few or none of the surrounding objects. In the cocktail party nightmare the“objects”each bat is trying to detect are its neighbors Our model of the cocktail party nightmare is designed to describe the auditory scene (Ulanovsky and Moss (2008)) of a bat emerging from a cave in a group as it echolocateson the wing. A focal bat flying in a group of N bats may detect up to N-1 of its neighbors (excluding itself), which is equivalent to hearing N-1 returning echoes. The focal bat receives 2 kinds of loud masking sounds that interfere with the detection of its neighbors: 1) the N-1 loud calls emitted by other bats in the group, and 2) the secondary echoes created by the call of a neighboring bat, reflecting once off another bat, and arriving at the focal bat. Every neighboring bat call generates N-2 secondary echoes, meaning that the focal bat can receive up to N-1xN-2 secondary echoes (Figure ). We implemented a spatially explicit 2-dimensional (2D) simulation of bat echolocation, sound propagation, and sound reception and include mammalian auditory phenomena to quantify how many and which neighbors a bat can detect in the sonar cocktail party nightmare. We then explored how changes in group size and in sender strategies affect neighbor detection in a group. 2.2.1 Model Scenarios We ran 2 model scenarios to test the effect of 1) increasing group size and of 2) variation in call parameters, group geometry, and acoustic parameters on neighbor detection. In all models, we used the central-most bat in the group as the focal bat. Scenario 1: Effect of group size on neighbor detection: We simulated groups of 5,10, 30, 50, 75, 100, and 200 well-aligned bats with identical echolocation and hearing properties flying at a minimum inter-bat distance of 0.5 m (Table 1 for full model parameters). The number and location of neighbors detected by the focal bat were recorded in every simulation run. Scenario 2: Effect of call parameters, group geometry, and acoustic parameters on neighbor detection: Here, we varied other parameters relevant to the cocktail party nightmare (Table 1) while keeping group size constant (n=100, i.e.,the largest group size from Scenario 1 with a biologically relevant neighbordetection rate). We varied call parameters (interpulse interval, call duration,source level), group parameters (heading variation, minimum inter-bat spacing), and acoustic parameters (atmospheric absorption, acoustic shadowing). 2.2.2 Model Implementation Each model run simulated 1 interpulse interval of the focal bat, and we calculated the timing and received level of all sounds (target echoes, masking calls, and secondary echoes) that arrived at the focal bat during that interpulse interval. Each model run simulated a series of sounds that arrived during an interpulse interval following the focal bats’ call, based on a spatially explicit distribution of a group of bats (SI Appendix, Schematic ). At the beginning of every model run,N bats were placed in a 2D space with randomly assigned heading directions (SI Appendix, sections 1.6 and 1.7). For each neighboring bat, we calculated its angle and distance to the focal bat. The received level was calculated based on a common source level for all bats, spherical and atmospheric spreading over each call’s and echo’s travel distance, and acoustic shadowing. Acoustic shadowing is the reduction in received level of a sound due to obstructions in its path. A sound in the cocktail party nightmare may pass around obstacles (other bats) as it propagates from source to receiver. The reduction in received level was measured and calculated as a linear function of the number of bats obstructing the path between source and receiver (SIAppendix, section 1.9).For target and secondary echoes, we also considered monostatic and bistatic target strengths measured in this paper (SI Appendix, section 1.8). The arrival time of target echoes within the interpulse interval was determined according to the 2-way travel time to the echo-reflecting neigh-boring bat. The arrival time of masking calls and secondary echoes was assigned randomly with uniform probability across the interpulse interval. The random arrival time assignment of calls and secondary echoes recreates the uncoordinated echolocation of all bats in the group. It is unlikely that multiple bats in large groups can coordinate their calls effectively, and in-dependent calling has been reported even in small groups of 4 bats (Hase (2018)). All bats in a group were identical in their calling properties, and we treated all sounds as constant tones of equal duration, i.e., we did not explicitly model spectral emission, propagation, and reception properties. The only difference between each of the sounds was their path and source of sound production. The omission of spectral properties is a conservative choice that assumes maximal masking of the primary echoes, thus allowing us to study the role of intensity differences and temporal separation between target echoes and masking sounds. Once we calculated the timing and received level of all sounds at the focal bat, we accounted for directional hearing sensitivity (SI Appendix, Figure )and spatial unmasking. Spatial unmasking describes the reduction in experienced masking as the arrival angle between masker and target sound increases (Ebata (2003), @)suemer2009a). We simulated spatial unmasking by the reduction of a masker’s effective received level based on its angular separation to an echo. For each echo, the same masker will have a different effective masking level as its relative angle of arrival will be unique for each echo. We thus calculated the effective masking level of each masker for each echo. The effective masking levels of all maskers were then combined to form a time-variant and echo-specific “masker SPL profile”(SI Appendix, Figure D). This is essentially the joint sound pressure level (SPL) of all maskers over time. We then expressed this echo-specific masker SPL profile in relation to the echo’s SPL, thus obtaining a relative“echo-to-masker ratio profile”(SI Appendix,Figure E). This is equivalent to a signal-to-noise ratio profile, where the echo is the signal and the masker profile is the noise. In addition to angular separation, signal detection is also determined by the temporal separation between signal (echo) and masker (Møhl and Surlykke (1989),Yost (2007a),Siewert, Schillinger, and Schmidt (2004)). Masking increases as the masker arrives closer in time to the echo. Masking occurs over longer durations when maskers arrive before the signal (forward masking)than afterward (backward masking). We recreated the asymmetric masking by a “temporal masking envelope”temporally centered at the echo (SI Appendix,Figure ). The echo was considered heard if the echo-to-masker ratio profile was above the temporal masking envelope. We allowed short drops of the echo-to-masker ratio profile below the temporal masking envelope, for a combined maximum duration of less than 25% of an echo’s duration. Alternatively, we defined an echo to be masked(=not heard), if the echo-to-masker ratio profile was below the temporal masking envelope for more than 25% of the echo duration. The 25% threshold was an arbitrarily chosen conservative value to prevent masking by rare and short bursts of high sound pressure level that are unlikely to affect echo detection biologically (SI Appendix,section2.7). 2.2.3 Model Parametrization We implemented a detailed set of echolocation, group and sound properties in our model, including call and hearing directionality,spatial unmasking, temporal masking, group geometry, and details of sound propagation. These properties were parameterized based on published results wherever available. Acoustic shadowing and target strengths (monostatic and bistatic) ofbats were specifically measured for this work. All details of the model parameters including our respective measurements and on model implementation are presented in the Supporting Information. 2.3 Results 2.3.1 Effect of Group Size on Neighbor Detection At group sizes of 5 and 10, the focal bat hears the echoes of most or all of its neighbors per call (median: 4 and 8 echoes per call at N=5 and 10, respectively; Figure ). At progressively larger group sizes, the median number of detected neighbors drops from 4 to 0 at group sizes of 30 to 200. Yet even in a group of 100 bats, while the median number of detected neighbors is zero, the 90th percentile is 1, showing that a neighbor is not detected with each call, but occasionally. Beyond a group of 100 bats, the focal bat typically detects no neighbors at all. The initial rise in detected neighbors in groups of 5 to 30 bats is primarily caused by the increased number of neighbors that could be detected, which is soon counter-acted by the intense masking that rises non linearly with group size. We next derived the probability of detecting at least 1 neighbor per call, which describes the average rate of neighbor detection (Figure A, blue). At smaller groups of 5 to 30 bats, the focal bat detects at least 1 neighbor per call at above0.95 probability. At larger group sizes (50 to 100), the probability of detecting at least 1 neighbor drops rapidly to 0.3 per call in a group of 100 bats, and is basically zero for a group of 200 bats (0.004 probability). A bat (with 10 Hz calling rate)flying in a group of 100 bats will thus detect at least 1 neighbor around 3 times per second (∼3 Hz detection rate), while a bat flying in a group of 30 bats will detect at least 1 neighbor almost every time it calls (9.5 Hz detection rate). The probability of detecting multiple bats per call is lower than just detecting at least 1 bat (Figure A). Yet,even in a group of 50 bats, the focal bat has a probability of detecting at least 2 and 4 neighbors per call of about 0.5 and 0.1, respectively. We next quantified which neighbors the focal bat detects. Detection is generally limited to nearby neighbors (Figure B) and, with increasing group size, to neighbors in front of the focal bat (Figure C). At a group size of 30 bats, the focal bat occasionally detects neighbors that are up to 2 m away in radial distance, which is the furthest neighbor distance. With increasing group sizes, despite the group being more spread out, the focal bat can only detect itsnearest neighbors (e.g., neighbors at∼0.5 m in a group of 200 bats;Figure B). In the azimuthal plane, at small group sizes, the focal bat initially detects neighbors all around it (95%-neighbor detection angle range≥237° for up to 50 bats; Figure C). With increasing group size, a frontal bias in neighbor detection appears (95%-neighbor detection angle range: 191 to 35° for 100 and 200 bats; Figure C). 2.3.2 Effect of Call Parameters, Group Geometry, and Acoustic Parameters on Neighbor Detection We next analyzed how variation in call parameters, group structure, and acoustic parameters affected neighbor detection. We fixed the group size to 100, as at this size,the focal bat could typically detect at most 1 neighbor (90%ile, Figure ) at 0.3 probability (Figure A) per call. We thus reduced the output of each simulation run to a binary neighbor detection score of 1 (detection) or 0 (no detection). We analyzed the effect of each parameter on neighbor detection with a logistic regression,treating all parameters as categorical and using their value in Scenario 1 as reference (parameter range in Table 1). The call parameters interpulse interval and call duration showed the strongest effect (Figure A and B and SI Appendix,TableS2). In-creasing the interpulse interval from 100 ms to 200 and 300 ms in-creases neighbor detection probability by about 15 and 75 times, while reducing it to 50ms lowers neighbor detection to 0.05 times (Figure A).Shortening call duration from 2.5 ms to 1 ms led to 35 times higher neighbor detection (Figure B). Call source level had no effect (Figure C). Group geometry also influenced neighbor detection probability,but less than changing call parameters. Flying at larger interbat distances of 1.0 m leads to 0.31 times lower neighbor detection compared to denser groups with 0.5 m interbat distance (Figure D).Groups where individuals head in a more variable direction have1.32 times better neighbor detection than groups with a generally common heading (or echolocation beam) direction (Figure E). Among the physical parameters, acoustic shadowing increased neighbor detection (without acoustic shadowing, neighbor detection is 0.75 times lower than with acoustic shadowing), while atmospheric attenuation had a negligible effect (Figure F and G) 2.4 Discussion We present a conceptual framework to quantify what a focal bat experiences in the sonar cocktail party nightmare. We quantified the probability of detecting neighbors across a range of group sizes, which allows calculating the rate at which a focal bat detects its neighbors. When flying alone, a focal bat will detect objects around it at a rate equal to its call rate, while in a group,its object detection rate is reduced due to masking. We show that even in a group of 100 bats, bats still detect at least 1 neighbor per call about 3 times per second (for a 10 Hz call rate), while in smaller group sizes, neighbor detection rate is larger at 5 to 10 Hz. Bat echolocation is generally “stroboscopic,”meaning that in-formation is received intermittently with time gaps (griffin1958a). We suggest that bats in smaller group sizes still experience a sufficiently high information update rate for performing collision avoidance and neighbor following. With increasing group size, perception might become “hyper-stroboscopic,”i.e., so scarce that different sensorimotor heuristics might be required to maintain group coordination. The low level of masking at smaller group sizes allows the focal bat to detect all its neighbors per call. With increasing group size,however, the focal bat detects maximally 1 neighbor per call in a group of 100 bats. This neighbor detection rate of at least 1 neighbor per call even in large group sizes provides a formal sensory basis for group movement in active sensing animals. While a bat in a large group cannot track the position of all its neighbors, it still can track the movement of a few neighbors, specifically those close to and in front of it. This reduction in rate, range, and direction of detected neighbors has predictive consequences for the kind of collective behavior bat groups may show in nature. Many models of collective movement assume that each individual in a group detects the position and orientation of neighbors in the whole of its sensory volume, and then performs an averaging across all neighbors to decide its next movement (Couzin et al. (2002),G. Grégoire (2004),Vicsek et al. (1995),Reynolds (1987)), leading to the impressive coordinated behaviors of fish schools and insect swarms (Sumpter (2006),Vicsek and Zafeiris (2012)). As the number of neighbors that an individual detects decreases, more “limited interactions” begin to dominate,causing anisotropy in the group structure (Bode, Franks, and Wood (2011),Ballerini et al. (2008)). For bats in the cocktail party nightmare, we predict that large groups may show higher anisotropy than smaller groups due to the limited number of neighbors that they can detect and react to. All things being equal, we predict that in large groups (&gt;50 bats), the neighbors in the frontal field of a bat will have a disproportionate influence on its movement decisions. Bats in larger groups may thus maintain higher alignment with their frontal neighbors compared to bats in smaller groups. Our simulations allow for a direct quantitative comparison of the effects of echolocation, group geometry, and acoustic parameters in group echolocation. Among the call parameterstested, reducing call rate (increasing interpulse interval) was most effective in increasing neighbor detection in jamming conditions, matching experimental evidence for reduced calling rate in Tadarida brasiliensis (Jarvis, Jackson, and Smotherman (2013), Adams, Davis, and Smotherman (2017)). In contrast, other FM batspecies increase their call rates in groups and background noise(Amichai, Blumrosen, and Y. (2015),Lin, Abaid, and Müller (2016),Noam Cvikel et al. (2015),Luo et al. (2015)). Likewise, our result that shorter call duration should improve neighbor detection is opposite to experiments showing that most bat species increased call duration in the presence of maskers (11, 23, 24, 43, 44), except (42). Lastly, ourresult of no effect of changing source level on neighbor detectionmight also seem to differ from experimental data showing thatbats in laboratory conditions do increase source level in thepresence of maskers (11, 23, 43, 44). While there might bespecies-specific variation, we suggest that these differences aremostly due to the experimental situation. Bats in these experi-ments experienced constant maskers. Calling more often, forlonger, and for louder thus improved the bats’signal redundancy,echo-to-masker ratio, and overall echo detection. In contrast,our model simulates group flight of many bats with simultaneousand uniform changes in their call parameters. When all bats in agroup shorten call duration, this reduces the overall duration ofmasking sounds, thus improving echo detection. Likewise, whenall bats in a group increase their call amplitudes to optimizetheir own echo-to-masker ratios, all bats will eventually call attheir maximum, with no overall effect on neighbor detection.Analyzing bat calls in mass emergences is technically challengingand it remains unknown whetherT. brasiliensisand other gre-garious bat species reduce their call rate in the field. Bat aggregations show a variety of structures across behavioralcontexts, from well-aligned almost parallel flight during roostemergences, to more variable and less-aligned flight in matingswarms and when circling in limited cave volumes. We show thatthis group structure itself affects how well bats can detect eachother. Bats detect their neighbors better in less-aligned groupscompared to more aligned groups. During aligned emergenceflight, the focal bat always receives loud forward-directedmasking calls from bats behind it, in addition to the relativelyloud side-calls emitted by neighbors to its left and right. In con-trast, during less-aligned swarming flight, the relative orientationof the bats is more distributed and changing, with the focal batexperiencing a wider dynamic range of masker levels (i.e., louderand fainter masking calls originating from a wider range of angulardirections). This increased dynamic masker range allows for betterecho detection, as there will be drops in echo-to-masker ratios dueto changing received masker level. This effect is beneficial forenabling swarming flight, as the collision risk in less-aligned flightis likely higher compared to the more aligned emergence flight. Interindividual distance is another parameter of group structure,and we show that neighbor detection is better in dense groups.This might seem unexpected given that the received SPL of themaskers is higher the closer the bats are to each other. However,received echo levels are also higher when bats are closely spaced.Since echo SPL drops by 12 dB per doubling of distance, but maskercall SPL only by 6 dB per doubling of distance, the echo-to-maskerratio is higher at shorter compared to longer interbat distances. Itwould be interesting to examine if perhaps large groups in the fieldactually fly closer to each other than smaller groups. While we only modeled neighbor detection for the central-mostbat in a group, its position in the group (e.g., central, frontal, or atthe back) is likely to also have an effect on the number and received level of maskers, and thus on the number of detectedechoes. However, we expect the obtained trends to remain qual-itatively the same regardless of focal bat position. Particularly, wepredict that masking will increase with group size, and only theexact group size at which a given level of masking (e.g., X%neighbor detection probability) is obtained will change dependingon the focal bat’s position in the group. We furthermore show that it is important to consider bats not only as sources of reflected echoes and masking sounds, but also as obstructions to sound that actually alleviate the cocktail party nightmare. Typically, the detected echoes originate from nearby bats and are not shadowed. In contrast, the masking calls and secondary echoes can arrive from distant neighbors,thus passing by multiple other bats. Shadowing thus consists ofthe overall reduction in masker levels, which increases echo-to-masker ratios for the comparatively loud echoes returning from nearby neighbors. Our results show that the cocktail party may not be as much of a “nightmare” as previously thought (9). We show that the modeled psychoacoustic, spatial, and acoustic properties act together to alleviate the nightmare into a challenge. When bats are flying in a multi echo environment, our results show that a bat will always hear some echoes after a call emission, and very rarely no echoes at all. This parallels the phenomenon of auditory “glimpsing”reported in the human auditory cocktail party where individuals may follow conversations by perceiving parts of detected speech rather than whole sounds (45) 2.4.1 Improved Echo Detection in Real-World Situations We present a first approximation to the sonar cocktail party nightmare, including many relevant biological, physical, and auditory mechanisms. Bats are expert echolocators and can detect echoes and fly under challenging conditions (Møhl and Surlykke (1989), Surlykke (1992),Petrites et al. (2009),Bates, Stamper, and Simmons (2008)). Bats rapidly adjust their call behavior in terms of their call duration, source level, and interpulse intervals (Luo and Moss (2017), Corcoran and Moss (2017)), integrate echoic information over multiple call emissions (Simmons and Gaudette (2012)), and actively track objects by aiming their calls at them (Ghose et al. (2006), Ghose and F (2006)). While we tested a range of differentecholocation call parameters, our model implemented these parameters as fixed values that do not vary over time, thus lacking the dynamic nature of a real bat in the wild. Furthermore, we did not model the spectral content of echo ormasker sounds, and analyzed echo detection based on a fixedthreshold of echo-to-masker-ratio. In contrast, real echolocation calls possess a time-variant spectral pattern that is species and even individual specific (Gillam (2010), Yovel et al. (2009)), which can reduce echo masking. Masking is strongest when target and masker overlap both intime and in frequency (i.e., fall within the same critical band ofthe auditory system) (Ebata (2003), Fletcher (1940)). The frequency-modulation of bat calls means that even when maskers and echoes partially overlap in time, they will not necessarily overlap in frequency, thus reducing the likelihood of masking. The individuality of bat calls may help a bat reject the secondary echoes from other bats’ calls by forming separate auditory streams (Fay (2008)) for its own echoes and others’ echoes. Given the scarcity of empirical data to parametrize the effect of spectral differences on echo detection in masking conditions, we did not include it in our model, thus simulating a conservative worst case scenario where all sounds lie in the same frequency band. Additionally, attentional processes strongly improve target detection by improving the signal-to-noise ratio in the presence of maskers with similar time-frequency structure (Hafter, Sarampalis, and Loui (2008)). Under real-world conditions, it is likely that masking in groups is even less than simulated here. Due to the scarcity of published data, the inter-individual and interspecific variation in the temporal and spatial masking functions used in our model is unknown. The temporal masking envelope will arguably be similar in many bat species, showing the typical mammalian pattern of worse target detection threshold with shorter temporal separation between target and masker. Spatial unmasking occurs through the nonlinear interaction of pinnae shape, cochlear and higher auditory processing (Ebata (2003), Culling and Stone (2017)). As pinna shape and associated acoustic receiver characteristics strongly vary in echolocating bats (Obrist et al. (1993)), this will lead to species-specific spatial unmasking and echo detection rates in the sonar cocktail party nightmare. 2.5 Conclusion We provide a conceptual framework to explain how active sensing animals such as echolocating bats successfully navigate in groups despite mutually jamming each other. The intense jamming in groups might lead to individuals only detecting their nearest frontal neighbors, which might drive limited interactions within a group. We also show that call parameters and group geometry determine the challenge in the sonar cocktail party nightmare. Recent advances in on-body acoustic tags (Noam Cvikel et al. (2015), Stidsholt et al. (2019)), signal analysis(Aodha (2018)), and acoustic tracking (Seibert et al. (2015)) of echolocating animals in the field might facilitate future experimental validation of our model predictions. As our model formulation is not constrained to echolocation in bats, it can be parametrized to other echolocators such as oilbirds, swiftlets, and odontocetes (Brinkløv, Fenton, and Ratcliffe (2013), Surlykke, Nachtigall, and R. (2014)) that also echolocate in groups and suffer from cocktail-party–like conditions. 2.5.1 Acknowledgements We thank the members of the Acoustic and Functional Ecology Group for insightful comments and support, Claire Guérin for contributing to code development, the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology for excellent research infrastructure, and 2 anonymous reviewers for helpful comments.

We only chose studies where the target and masker were co-located along the same direction. Both studies presented the ratio between the echo and masker SPL at target detection for various delays between echo and masker arrival time. We linearly interpolated (in a piecewise fashion) the echo-to-masker SPL ratios between each of the time delays measured in the studies to obtain the full temporal masking envelope ranging from -0.65 and +24 ms delay of the target echo relative to the masker edge (Figure ). 2.6.1.2 Spatial unmasking function Sümer et al. (2009) performed a backward masking study to address spatial unmasking in the bat Eptesicus fuscus. In a two-alternative forced-choice paradigm, they increased the angular separation between a target object and a masker object while also varying the level of the target object’s echo (by varying the size of the target object and thus the target object’s target strength). We define the spatial unmasking function as the echo-to-masker SPL ratio at just-noticeable echo detection as a function of angular separation. To obtain the echo-to-masker level ratios, we subtracted the target object’s target strengths from the masker object’s target strength. We normalized the spatial unmasking function to the co-localised echo-masker case (i.e., when both echo and masker arrive from the same direction). This describes the reduction in echo-to-masker ratio required for echo detection as a function of angular separation between target and masker,compared to the co-localized case. We digitized the data points from Figure B of Sümer et al. (2009) by hand with WebPlotDigitiser (Rohatgi 2015) to obtain the target’s target strength as a function of angular separation. Masker target strength was given by Sümer et al. (2009) as -14.5 dB. We then calculated the target-masker SPL ratios and interpolated them with a quadratic polynomial fit (Figure ). The interpolated data was then further upsampled to 0.47° intervals. As Sümer et al. (2009) only measured angular separations up to 23°. We conservatively used the echo-masker SPL ratio at 23° also for all larger angular separations. 2.6.1.3 Call and hearing directionality Echolocation calls have a directional beam shape, meaning that the emitted SPL generally decreases with increasing angular distance from the main call direction, which has the highest call SPL (Figure ). The highest call SPL is typically towards the front, and reduces towards the back of the bat. Despite this directionality and additional variation with call frequency and behavioral context (Jakobsen and Surlykke 2010,@l2013a,@surlykke2012a,@giuggioli2015a) , bats still emit a significant amount of sound pressure into the backward direction. The average call SPL behind a bat is about 14 dB lower than in the forward direction (Giuggioli, McKetterick, and Holderied 2015,@stidsholt2018a). Call directionality leads to a drop in the effective number of masking calls from neighbors as only those calls arriving from a limited range of directions will have sufficiently high SPL (Figure ). For example, in an emergence situation with approximately parallel flight directions, the focal bat will receive the loudest calls from those bats flying behind it. Similarly, the lowest received call levels in an emergence will be from those bats flying in front of the focal bats. Like call production, hearing is also directional. The pinna structure of a bat attenuates or amplifies the same sound depending on its direction of arrival (Firzlaff and Schuller 2003, @f2008a). In Myotis daubentonii, hearing directionality between 35-45 kHz leads to an average amplification of frontally arriving sounds by 4 dB in comparison to those arriving from behind. We used data of Giuggioli et al (2015) to describe the average call and hearing directionality of our modelled bats (Figure ). 2.6.1.4 Atmospheric attenuation Ultrasound in air is heavily attenuated by atmospheric attenuation, even over short distances of a few meters (Goerlitz 2018, @lawrence1982a). Atmospheric attenuation will reduce the received SPL of a masker or echo at the focal bat. We chose a range of values for the atmospheric attenuation coefficient α between 0 to -2 dB/m. These values approximate the atmospheric attenuation experienced by a bat calling at very low (\\(\\leq\\) 20 kHz, ~0 dB/m) to high (60 kHz, ~-2 dB/m) peak frequencies. 2.6.1.5 Geometric attenuation Sound pressure level reduces with increasing distance from the source, called geometric attenuation. For all sounds in our model (target echoes, masking calls and secondary echoes), we implemented spherical geometric spreading, i.e., uniform spreading of sound in all directions(Speaks 1996). 2.6.1.6 Group geometry A group of bats might organize themselves tightly or well spread in the field. The spacing between bats will decide how loud the returning target echoes, masking calls and secondary echoes are. We simulated a group of bats by placing individual bats on a 2D plane using the Poisson disk algorithm (Bridson 2007). The advantage of using the Poisson disk algorithm is that points are spaced relatively uniformly in space compared to a random placement of points from two independent distributions. The other advantage of the Poisson disk algorithm is that it allows the specification of a minimum distance between two points. For the first simulations varying group size only, we chose 0.5 m as inter-bat distance (see Table 1, main text), matching the average interbat-distance in dense swarms of T. brasiliensis in the field (Theriault et al. 2010). In addition to 0.5 m minimum inter-bat distance, we also studied how a sparser 1.0 m minimum inter-bat distance affects neighbor detection (see Table 1, main text). The Poisson disk arranged bats showed average inter-bat distances of between 1-1.5 times the specified minimum distance between points. 2.6.1.7 Heading variation Active sensing animals are known to ‘scan’ their environments by emitting energy in varying directions of interest according to the behavioral context (Wisniewska 2015, @bullock2005a). Bats alter the shape and direction of their sonar beam while they fly (Jakobsen and Surlykke 2010, @ghose2006a, @w2017a). The directions into which each bat in a group aims its calls could affect how well each bat in the group can detect echoes. A group of bats calling into the same direction may experience high masking, as a focal individual will receive many loud calls from the bats behind it. In contrast, a group of bats calling into a larger range of directions may experience less masking. The focal bat may receive a mix of fainter off-axis calls and loud on-axis calls from neighbors. We simulated the scanning behavior of individual bats in the group by setting a heading angle for each individual. Each individual called into the direction of its heading angle, and we chose two levels of variation of heading angles in the group. Groups with a low heading variation were all pointing their beams in more or less the same direction. Groups with high heading variation were pointing their beams in a wider range of directions. A low heading variation simulates an emergence situation where each bat is calling approximately into the overall flight direction of the group. A high heading variation simulates a swarming situation where each bat is calling at a unique direction. Given the lack of empirical data to guide our estimates, we chose \\(\\pm\\) 10° for the low heading variation, and \\(\\pm\\) 90° for the high heading variation. The heading angle for each individual was randomly drawn from a uniform distribution covering the respective range. 2.6.1.8 Monostatic and bistatic target strength of a flying bat Quantifying the received levels of echoes and secondary echoes requires knowledge of the target strength of a bat when emitter and receiver are at the same and at different locations. Here, we measured monostatic and bistatic target strengths (Richards, J., and Holm 2010) of a flying stuffed Myotis myotis bat. Monostatic target strengths refer to the situation where the emitter and receiver are at the same location, i.e.,they are the same bat (this is the ‘classical’ target strength usually considered in echolocation research). Bistatic target strength refers to a situation where the emitter and receiver are at different locations, i.e., the receiving bat hears the echo of a call that was emitted by another bat, i.e. a secondary echo. In the simulations, all incoming and outgoing sounds at the bat are between abs(0-180)°. Sounds with 0° angle are along the heading direction of the focal bat. Sounds arriving/reflecting on the left have negative angles (0° \\(\\geq \\theta \\geq\\)-180°), and those on the right have positive angles (0° $$180°). Methods: We ensonified a stuffed Myotis myotis with outstretched wings, which was suspended from the ceiling at ~1 m height and placed on a rotating base, which could be rotated in 45° steps. A speaker (electrostatic Polaroid, custom built) and microphone (CM16/CMPA, Avisoft Bioacoustics, Glienicke, Germany) were placed at a 1 m radial distance to the center of the bat (Figure ). The speaker emitted linear frequency modulated sweeps between 96-20 kHz, with durations of 170 μs, 1 ms and 2 ms at 92 dB rms SPL re 20 μPa at 1 m. The speaker was driven by a custom-built amplifier with input from a soundcard (Player 216H, Avisoft Bioacoustics, 1 MHz sampling rate). The microphone signal was recorded simultaneously with an attenuated version of the speaker signal on a multichannel soundcard (USG 416H, Avisoft Bioacoustics, 500 kHz sampling rate). The microphone had a noise floor of 24 dB rms SPL re 20 μPa. All echoes were recorded at \\(\\geq\\) 22dB signal-to-noise ratio. The experiment was performed in the middle of a large empty room (~4x4x2 m) to temporally separate bat echoes from background echoes. We ensonified the bat from front (0°) to back (180°) in steps of 45°. We assumed that the bat was symmetrical and thus did not ensonify angles from 180-360°. The angular separation between the speaker and the microphone was also altered in steps of 45° between -180° to +180°. This resulted in 40 target strength measurements (5 sound directions x 8 angular separations). The integrated target strength (Cook 1985) of the recordings were calculated by subtracting the energy of recordings with the bat from those without the bat at the expected time window of echo arrival. The echo level was calculated in rms by taking the square root of the energy. Results: The monostatic target strength of a flying stuffed Myotis myotis bat at various orientations was between -43 and -34 dB at 1 m distance, matching the general range of previously published values (Götze et al. 2016). The bistatic target strength, which was used to calculate the received level of the secondary echoes, was between -44 and -10 dB across all combinations of emitter-receiver locations.

Essentially, the bats themselves act as obstacles that cause acoustic shadowing, reducing the received sound pressure level at the focal bat. In a large group, multiple bats may shadow a sound as it moves from the emitter and to the receiver. We quantified acoustic shadowing in a series of playback experiments that varied the inter-bat spacing (0.5 and 1.0 m) and the number of bats (1 – 6) in a line. Methods: A microphone (CM16/CMPA, Avisoft Bioacoustics) and speaker (Polaroid, custom-built) were placed at a fixed distance of 9.9 m apart, facing each other. We hung 1 to 6 “model bats” made of foam with paper wings at 0.5 or 1.0 m distance to each other from a string running above the speaker to the microphone. The designed model bat showed acoustic shadowing similar to that of the stuffed Myotis myotis used in the target strength measurements described in 1.8. The speaker was placed as far as possible from the microphone to calculate acoustic shadowing without the effects of speaker directionality. The speaker played back a variety of 7 ms Tukey windowed signals consisting of pure tones (20, 35, 50, 100 kHz) and a downward modulated linear sweep (100-15 kHz). Each signal type was played back 15 times at ~4% duty cycle. Multiple signal types were used to obtain a generalized estimate of shadowing across a wide range of call peak frequencies and call types. The playback signals and recordings are available here: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3469845. Additionally, we also recorded the same playback without model bats being present. We calculated acoustic shadowing as the reduction in received level by subtracting the received level (in dB rms) without bats from the received level with bats. We performed a linear regression of attenuation as a function of factors number of bats and inter-bat-distance, to estimate the amount of acoustic shadowing caused per bat and the spacing between them. Results: Bats effectively shadowed the sound, with strong effects of the inter-bat-spacing and the number of bats. Bats at 0.5 m distance in front of the receiving bat (=microphone) reduced the received SPL by 5.17 dB (SEM=0.44, t=-11.639, 95% CI =-6.05,-4.30), while bats at 1.0 m interbat-spacing reduced the received SPL by 1.85 dB (SEM=0.44, t=-4.164, 95% CI =-2.72,-0.98). Each bat reduced received SPL by 0.83 dB (SEM=0.08, t=-9.852, 95% CI =-0.99,-0.66). For further details on experimental protocol, raw data and reproduction of generated results, please refer to the archived Jupyter notebooks at this link: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3469845. 2.6.2 Model implementation Here, we present how we implemented the parameters described before into our final model, and how our model was initialized and run. 2.6.2.1 Model idea The idea of our model is to analyze the relative timing and sound pressure level of target echoes, masking calls and secondary echoes at a focal bat flying in a group of other bats. Each model iteration thus analyzed one single interpulse interval, i.e., the time after emission of one call until the emission of the next call by the focal bat. Within that interpulse interval, the focal bat received the echoes from its own call that reflected off the neighboring bats, the calls of those neighboring bats, and the secondary echoes which originate from the calls of the neighboring bats reflecting off other neighboring bats (Figure , main text). We placed groups of bats in a 2D plane with various inter-bat distances and heading directions. We then calculated received timing and SPL of all sounds based on realistic assumptions about call properties, mammalian auditory characteristics and sound physics. All echoes, calls and secondary echoes were considered to be equal in duration, amplitude envelope, and frequency composition. Frequency composition was not explicitly specified, which is a conservative modelling choice that maximizes masking potential (Yost 2007b) and makes our model generalizable to multiple bat species. All sounds were treated as having a constant amplitude envelope (i.e., no amplitude modulations), but they differed in the sound pressure level received by the focal bat. 2.6.2.2 Model initialization Each model iteration consisted of distributing bats in a 2D plane and assigning each bat a heading direction. This spatial distribution was used to calculate the arrival times and received level of target echoes, masker calls and secondary echoes within the interpulse interval (Figure ). The interpulse interval was discretized into time bins of 1 \\(\\mu\\)s duration. Each received target echo corresponded to one neighbor. The arrival time of each echo was calculated using twice the distance between focal and neighboring bat. The arrival time of masker calls and secondary echoes were chosen randomly. The random arrival time assignment of masker calls and secondary echoes is supported by the finding that groups of Miniopterus fuliginosus (Hase 2018) do not coordinate their calling behavior, and seem to echolocate independently. Moreover, at large group sizes beyond a few bats it is unlikely that bats could effectively co-ordinate their call emission times. 2.6.2.3 Target echo properties Target echoes are the echoes that the focal bat receives in response to its own echolocation call. In our model, the target echoes are echoes reflected off the neighboring bats. When a focal bat hears a target echo it means it has detected the corresponding neighboring bat. An echo was defined as a sound occupying a block of time within the interpulse interval (Figure A). Echoes were simulated to arrive at delays corresponding to the distance to the neighboring bat they reflected off, e.g. if a neighboring bat was at 1 m distance to the focal bat, then its echo arrived at a delay of 6.06 ms (at 330 m/s sound propagation). The received level of the returning echo was calculated based on emitted call source level into the direction of the neighboring bat, our monostatic target strength measurements of a bat, and geometric attenuation over the sound travel distance. If acoustic shadowing and atmospheric absorption were included in a simulation run, the received level was reduced based on the number of bats in the path and the atmospheric attenuation for the overall distance travelled by the echo. Echo arrival direction was determined based on the position of each neighboring bat. 2.6.2.4 Masker call properties Masker calls arrived at random time points with uniform probability within the interpulse interval (Figure B), based on the observed lack of call synchronization in groups of Miniopterus fuliginosus (Hase 2018). Call directionality was based on the directionality function in Giuggioli et al., 2015, who fit a cosine based function to describe the overall call directionality of Myotis daubentonii echolocating in the field. We set the asymmetry parameter A to 7.0. We calculated the angle of call emission towards the focal bat for each conspecific bat based on its angular position (heading) and distance. We then calculated the effective source level into the direction of the focal bat by reducing the call’s on-axis source level (Table 1 in main text) according to the call directionality function and the focal bat’s relative position to the conspecific (Figure ). This reduced level was the final received level of the conspecific masker call. If acoustic shadowing and atmospheric attenuation were included in a simulation run, the received level was reduced based on the number of bats in the path and the overall distance travelled by the call. 2.6.2.5 Secondary echo properties Like the masking calls, secondary echoes arrived randomly with uniform probability in the interpulse interval (Figure C). The received level of a secondary echo was based on the emitted call source level into the direction of the neighboring bat, our bistatic target strength measurements of a bat, and geometric attenuation over the sound travel distance. If acoustic shadowing and atmospheric absorption were included in a simulation run, the received level was reduced based on the number of bats in the path and the overall distance travelled by the secondary echo. 2.6.2.6 Obtaining the masker sound pressure level profile All sounds were treated as having a fixed received level (no envelope modulations). For each target echo, we calculated its unique masker SPL profile based on the relative timing, relative arrival directions and received levels of all asking calls and secondary echoes. This masker SPL profile was different for each target echo because the temporal and spatial properties of the masking sounds differ for each echo, resulting in different received levels and spatial unmasking (see main text for details). We first calculated the effective masker SPL for each masking sound by correcting for spatial unmasking based on the angular separation between the echo and the masker. All effective masker SPLs of all masking sounds together over time represent the complete masker sound pressure profile for each target echo (Figure E). When two or more maskers overlapped in time, we added their linear sound pressures to obtain their joint masking SPL. This approach assumes that overlapping maskers are coherent sound sources that constructively interfere. This is a conservative assumption that will maximize masking. 2.6.2.7 Determining neighbor detection: the temporal masking envelope The masker SPL profile for each echo describes the received masking SPL over time. From the masker SPL profile, we created an echo-to-masker ratio profile by normalizing the SPL of the target echo to the masker SPL profile: echo-to-masker ratio profile (dB) = echo level (dB SPL) – masker sound pressure level (dB SPL) The echo-to-masker-ratio profile is comparable to a signal-to-noise-ratio: at 0 dB, echo and masker have the same SPL. The masker is louder than the echo for negative values, and the echo is louder than the masker for positive values. To determine whether a given target echo was heard or not, we compared the echo-to-masker ratio for this echo with the temporal masking envelope (see ). The temporal masking envelope describes the echo-to-masker ratio at which masking occurs as a function of relative timing between echo and masker. Using the temporal masking envelope is important because masking does not only occur when the masker coincides with the echo, but also when the masker does not overlap with the echo and arrives before (forward masking) or after (backward masking) it. In our case, echo and masker had durations of only 1-2.5 ms, while a masker arriving at up to ~25 ms before and up to ~1 ms after the echo still causes some amount of masking. Thus, our temporal masker envelope had a duration of either ~27 or ~28.5 ms (Figure F). We compared the echo-to-masker ratio profile to the temporal masking envelope. The echo was considered not heard if the echo-to-masker ratio profile lay below the temporal masking envelope, i.e., the echo-to-masker ratio was lower than required for echo detection. Alternatively, the echo was considered heard if the echo-to-masker ratio profile lay above the temporal masking function, i.e., the echo-to-masker SPL ratio was higher than required for echo detection. However, as the echo-to-masker ratio continuously fluctuates over time, it is possible that it is not fully above or below the temporal masking envelope throughout the envelope’s duration. We thus defined an echo to be masked (= not heard), if it was masked for more than 25% of its duration (of 1 or 2.5 ms). To calculate the total duration of masking, we analyzed the total duration that the echo-to-masker ratio was below the temporal masking envelope. As long as the total masking duration was shorter than 25% of the echo duration (of 1-2.5 ms) the echo was considered detected. If this duration was longer than 25% of the echo duration, the echo was masked and the corresponding neighboring bat was considered not detected. This 25% threshold was set to make the simulated auditory system immune to short spikes in masking sound pressure level occurring during the temporal masking function. 2.6.3 Open-source software used in the research All simulation code, experimental data and results were made possible through the use of the NumPy (Oliphant 2006), SciPy (Virtanen 2019), Pandas (McKinney 2010), Matplotlib (Hunter 2007), Statsmodels (Seabold and Perktold 2010), sounddevice (Geier 2015), Anaconda (Anaconda 2016) and CPython (Van Rossum 1991) open-source projects. 2.6.4 Acknowledgements We thank Renate Heckel and Felix Hartl for contributing to and building the ensonification setup, Magnus Wahlberg for helpful discussions on the ensonifications, Henrik Brumm for permission to use Raum 1.03 for the ensonification experiments, and Mihai Valcu for facilitating simulation runs on the in-house server facility. 2.6.5 Supplementary Schematics, Tables and Figures Pseudo-code of the steps in a simulation run to determine the detected neighbors per call emission.

In ICASSP 2019-2019 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP) (pp. 4410-4414). IEEE. Abstract In this paper we study the problem of estimating receiver and sender positions from time-difference-of-arrival measurements, assuming an unknown constant time-difference-of-arrival offset. This problem is relevant for example for repetitive sound events. In this paper it is shown that there are three minimal cases to the problem. One of these (the five receiver, five sender problem) is of particular importance. A fast solver (with run-time under \\(4~ \\mu s\\)) is given. We show how this solver can be used in robust estimation algorithms, based on RANSAC, for obtaining an initial estimate followed by local optimization using a robust error norm. The system is verified on both real and synthetic data. 5.1 Introduction The problem of estimating receiver-sender node positions from measured arrival times of radio or sound signals is a key issue in different applications such as microphone array calibration, radio antenna array calibration, mapping and positioning. This field is well researched but in this paper we will focus on the anchor-free sensor network calibration both in terms of time-of-arrival measurements (TOA) and time-difference-of-arrival measurements (TDOA). For time-of-arrival the planar case of three receivers and three senders (3R/3S) was solved in . For the full 3D case the over-determined problem (10R/4S) was studied in , where a solver for this non-minimal case was provided. There are actually three minimal cases for the 3D case, namely (4R/6S), (5R/5S) and (6R/5S). A practical solver was presented in . There are in general \\(38\\), \\(42\\) and \\(38\\) solutions respectively for the three different set ups. Faster solvers for these minimal cases were provided in . In this paper we study the constant offset TDOA self-calibration problem. It is a problem that naturally arises e.g. when signals are emitted with a known period. As an estimation problem it lies between TOA and full TDOA. In the paper we study the minimal (5R/5S) problem and provide a fast (few \\(\\mu s\\)) solver. Robust parameter estimation often use the hypothesize and test paradigm, e.g. using random sampling consensus, or one of its many variants . In these frameworks minimal solvers are important building blocks for generating model hypotheses, and %DEGSAC - degenerate ransac solver - relevant if we do 4x4 solver we show in the paper how a minimal solver can be used for robust parameter estimation of sender positions, receiver positions and unknown offset. The system is capable of handling missing data, outliers and noise. The algorithms are tested on synthetic data as well as real data, in an office environment and in a cave.The methods are straightforward to generalize for degenerate configurations which arise if senders or receivers are restricted to a plane or to a line. 5.2 Time-difference-of-arrival self calibration The problem we are considering involves \\(m\\) receiver positions \\(\\mathbf{r}_i \\in \\mathbb R^3\\), $ i = 1, , m,$ and \\(n\\) sender positions \\(\\mathbf{s}_j \\in ^3\\), $ j = 1, , n$.

Using acoustic tracking, biologists can detect the position of the animal and track it through space as it moves over time. The localisation accuracy of an acoustic tracking system depends on a variety of factors. There are internal factors such as microphone array geometry, signal processing routines, and the mathematical formulations used to localise sounds (time-of-arrival, time-of-arrival-difference, angle-of-arrival, power-steering). The external factors include aspects related to the actual signal itself, ie. signal-to-noise ratio, and spectro-temporal properties of the emitted sound (noise, linear/hyperbolic sweep) (Wahlberg 1999). While experiments and analytical modelling may be the definitive way to determine a tracking system’s end accuracy, simulations allow a quick and systematic method to estimate the source of tracking errors. tacost provides a flexible workflow to manipulate and study the effect of both internal and external factors. tacost generates audio files for source positions and array geometries specified by the user. This allows the user to analyse the efficacy of their tracking system’s baseline performance. References "],

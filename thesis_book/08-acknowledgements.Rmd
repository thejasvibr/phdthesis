Neetash for playing the multiple roles of friend, colleague and wife over the past few years.
All current and past members of the  Acoustic and Functional Ecology group for a great working environment. Office mates Daniel and Theresa.

My parents, for allowing me to follow my weird ideas as a child of becoming at various points a vet and then a 'zoologist' (even before I actually knew what the word meant). I am definitely neither of the two, but am quite happy with whatever my current field of work is called!

Reni and Dieter for providing an oasis to retreat from work and their amazing company.

And finally, I would not be here without all the bats flying through the night. All the bats that hung around as I fumbled with cables with numb hands on cold autumn nights, as I learnt to patiently deal with (hundreds of?) metres of tangled cable every night, and set up equipment hoping they'd land up. When they did it was always a pleasure to watch and hear them. So here's to all you hovercraft Daubis, hyper pipistrelles and gliding Mouse-eared bats, none of this would have been possible without all of you!
